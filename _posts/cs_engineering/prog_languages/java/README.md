# NGI Academy Java Learning Documentation
Refreshing your Java skills and preparing for the transition to Java microservices involves covering various aspects. Here's a one-week learning plan tailored to your goals:

## Day 1-2: Java Basics Refresher

### Language Syntax:

Review Java syntax, data types, control flow, and basic language features.
Focus on any updates introduced in recent Java versions (e.g., Java 8, 11, or later).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

### Revisit OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Practice designing classes and understanding interfaces.

## Day 3-4: Microservices Architecture
Microservices Fundamentals:

### Study microservices architecture principles and characteristics.
Understand service independence, bounded contexts, and API design.
### Spring Boot Framework:

Dive into Spring Boot, a popular framework for Java microservices.
Explore how Spring Boot simplifies microservices development.
## Day 5: CI/CD and Automation
### Continuous Integration (CI):

Learn CI practices using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
Set up a sample Java project with automated builds.
Continuous Deployment (CD):

### Understand CD practices, automated testing, and deployment pipelines.
Configure a pipeline for deploying microservices.
## Day 6: Scaling and Monitoring
### Scaling Microservices:

Explore strategies for scaling microservices horizontally and vertically.
Understand load balancing and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
### Monitoring and Observability:

Learn monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Micrometer.
Explore logging, tracing, and metrics for observability.
## Day 7: Business Continuity
### Resilience Patterns:

Understand resilience patterns (e.g., Circuit Breaker, Retry) using tools like Hystrix.
Implement fault tolerance mechanisms.
### Disaster Recovery:

Plan for disaster recovery scenarios and implement strategies.
Explore backup and restore procedures.
## Additional Tips:
### Hands-On Projects:

Apply concepts by working on a small microservices project.
Break down the monolith incrementally into microservices.
### Community and Documentation:

Engage with Java and microservices communities for support and best practices.
Refer to official documentation for Java, Spring Boot, and related tools.
### Testing Strategies:

Explore testing methodologies for microservices, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

By the end of this one-week plan, you should have a solid foundation in Java, microservices principles, CI/CD practices, automation, scaling, monitoring, and ensuring business continuity. Adjust the pace based on your familiarity with certain topics. Good luck with your learning journey!
